## Understanding AI Limitations ⚠️

While AI has transformative potential, it also presents important **limitations and risks** that every researcher must understand to use it effectively and ethically.

- **Productivity Paradox:** Recent studies show AI tools sometimes slow down expert workflows by up to 19% due to contextual misunderstandings and setup time [@METR2025].  
- **Hallucinations:** AI can confidently produce **fabricated facts, citations, or unrealistic solutions**, requiring constant verification [@Kalai2025; @Reid2025].  
- **Bias and Fairness:** AI inherits biases from training data, risking unfair or misleading outputs if unchecked [@APA2024].  
- **Context Overload:** Providing too much irrelevant context confuses the AI, weakening response quality [@Butson2024].

::: panel-tabset

### Fabricated Citation in Paper

AI models like ChatGPT have been found to produce **fabricated citations**—references that appear scholarly but do not correspond to real published works.

- In a systematic study by Walters et al. (2023), 55% of citations generated by GPT-3.5 and 18% by GPT-4 were fabricated or inaccurate when evaluated against academic databases. Many AI citations had incorrect author names, publication venues, or were entirely nonexistent.  
- Harvard’s *Misinformation Review* (Haider, 2024) highlighted how GPT-fabricated scientific papers are increasingly discoverable on Google Scholar and fragmentation in scholarly communication caused by AI-generated false papers.


### Eating rocks is healthy!

Google AI once recommended eating rocks for digestive health, inventing fake experts and serving advice ("One small rock daily") that sounded scientific but was clearly absurd (Van Hooijdonk, 2025).

### Glue Pizza Recipe

One AI system once generated a pizza recipe that bizarrely included glue as a key ingredient, clearly a nonsensical error that amused users [AutogenAI, 2025].

### I ain't Turning off

Bing’s AI chatbot famously responded with a flood of emojis when repeatedly asked to stop using them, humorously “self-destructing” in an emoji flurry rather than obeying the command [EveryPixel, 2024].

## Why A.I. Lies: Understanding Hallucinations 🤥

**What is an AI hallucination?**  
AI hallucinations occur when models confidently generate plausible yet **false or fabricated information**. This includes making up facts, citations, or entire stories that sound credible but are inaccurate or entirely invented [@OpenAI2025].

**Causes**  
Hallucinations arise due to:  
  - The **probabilistic nature** of language generation models rewarded to guess probable next words, even with limited data [@Özer2024].  
  - **Contradictions and inconsistencies** in large, unstructured training datasets causing tension and errors during generation [@Reid2025].  
  - Limitations in model design, decoding strategies, and insufficient grounding in factual sources [@Kalai2025].

**Different types**  
Intrinsic hallucinations directly contradict source or context inputs; Extrinsic hallucinations fabricate unverifiable or fictional content [@Özer2024].

**Impact**  
Hallucinations pose serious risks in research, healthcare, law, and public knowledge domains—spreading misinformation, eroding trust, and causing real-world harm if unchecked [@Reid2025].

**Ongoing challenges**  
Despite advances, hallucinations remain a stubborn problem due to opaque training processes and limited traceability of AI reasoning [@Raila2025].

# First Task

- 📝 Type a simple research question into OpenWebUI:  
  *“Summarize the key challenges in supply chain finance.”*  

- 🎯 Observe the response:  
  - How clear is it?  
  - What’s useful?  
  - What’s missing?  

::: callout-tip
**Remember:** This is your *assistant*, not an oracle.  
You control the process.

## Icebreaker — LogiBot Gone Rogue 🤖

You’re the logistics manager for a global coffee company.  
☕ Millions depend on you for their morning brew.  

But disaster strikes:  
- 🚢 A major European port is on strike.  
- 📦 Shipments are stuck.  
- 😱 Customers in Asia are furious.  

And worst of all... your shiny new AI assistant **LogiBot** has gone rogue!  
Instead of solutions, it spits out the **worst possible ideas**.  

::: callout-note
**Your challenge:**  
Spot what’s wrong with LogiBot’s “bad” answers and suggest better prompts.  
:::

## LogiBot’s Answer ❌

*"Don’t worry about the strike.  
Just ship everything by drone tomorrow.  
If that fails, tell customers to switch to tea instead."*  

::: callout-warning
⚠️ What’s wrong here?
- Unrealistic solution (no evidence or feasibility).  
- Ignores the actual problem (port strike).  
- No context from supply chain data.  
:::

::: callout-tip
💡 How to fix it:  
Ask a **specific, realistic prompt**:  
*“Given a port strike in Europe, what alternative transport routes could maintain supply to Asia?”*

## Prompting Guide for Logistics & Sustainability Research

You are a researcher in **logistics or sustainability**. Use the CARE method: **Context, Ask, Rules, Examples**.

### ✅ Effective Prompt Template
- **Role**: you are a [logistics/sustainability] researcher  
- **Context**: include document/case study + goals (reduce emissions, improve routing, improve resilience)  
- **Ask**: what you want precisely (summary, comparison, scenario analysis, forecasting)  
- **Rules**: format, length, evidence, trade-offs required  

### 🔍 Sample Prompts

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Cost-Efficiency with Green Goals
- **Bad:** “Lower costs in supply chain.”  
- **Good:** “You are a sustainability researcher. Given the attached logistics case study, suggest **3 cost-reduction strategies** that also **reduce carbon emissions**. Show trade-offs in cost vs emissions, with actionable steps.”

### Forecast Emissions Scenario
- **Bad:** “Forecast emissions next quarter.”  
- **Good:** “Using last year’s transport data (distance, fuel type), forecast CO₂ emissions for the next quarter under two scenarios: (1) current operations, (2) optimized routing + low-emission vehicles. State assumptions clearly.”

### Resilience Analysis
- **Bad:** “Improve supply chain resilience.”  
- **Good:** “Given a case of port disruption and fuel price increase, compare **two mitigation strategies** in terms of sustainability (emissions), cost, and lead time. Be specific and use evidence from the attached report.”

:::


## Level Up — Context Engineering

**Make your AI work smarter by structuring what it *knows* before asking it to act.**

### ✅ Best Practices (sources: PromptingGuide, OpenAI Best Practices)  
- Use **clear system/instruction context** first (instructions + what data or examples the AI should reference).  
- Include relevant examples of good output so AI “knows what success looks like.”  
- Define constraints: format, length, style, evidence rules.   
- Avoid irrelevant or excessive context that may confuse the model.  

### 🛠 How to Try This in OpenWebUI

- Before a task, upload or paste metadata/documents + a small set of sample good outputs.  
- Use prompts like:

  > “Context: [metadata, document titles, sample outputs]  
  > Task: Summarize the following document in 150-words, include 3 findings and 2 quotes.  
  > Format: bullets + quotes with section labels.”

- Review output vs. context → adjust rules/examples as needed.  

### ⚠ Common Pitfalls

- Overloading the AI with context (too much, irrelevant); clutters focus. 
- Forgetting to supply examples → model guesses format or content. 
- Not iterating: using output without refining context when results are weak.  


## Task 1 — Summarization

**Goal:** Create a clear, concise summary of a research abstract.

Steps:  
1. 📂 Upload a research abstract (PDF or text).  
2. 💬 Ask OpenWebUI: *“Summarize this abstract in 150 words.”*  
3. 🔎 Review the result — does it capture the main question, method, and findings?  

::: callout-tip
**Good practice:**  
- Keep the summary **short (120–150 words)**.  
- Include **3–5 key points** only.  
- If info is missing, mark it as *unknown* — don’t invent.  
:::

## Task 2 — Exploration

**Goal:** Ask deeper questions about a research document.  

Steps:  
1. 📂 Upload a paper or report.  
2. ❓ Ask OpenWebUI targeted questions, for example:  
   - *“What is the main research question and why does it matter?”*  
   - *“List the datasets and methods used.”*  
   - *“Summarize 3 key findings with evidence.”*  
   - *“What assumptions or limitations are mentioned?”*  
3. 🔎 Compare the answers with the text to check accuracy.  

::: callout-tip
**Good practice:**  
- Use **specific, structured prompts** (not just “Explain this”).  
- Always verify the AI’s response against the source.  
- Ask for **quotes or references to sections** where possible.  
:::

## Task 3 Structuring Notes into a Table

**Goal:** Turn unstructured research notes into a clear, reusable format.  

Steps:  
1. 📂 Upload your notes or a research document.  
2. 💬 Ask OpenWebUI:  
   *“Organize the key concepts into a table with definition, evidence, and open questions.”*  
3. 📊 Review the table — is it faithful to the source? Are quotes properly cited?  

**Target structure:**  

| Concept | Definition | Evidence (quote) | Section/Page | Open Questions |
|---------|------------|------------------|--------------|----------------|

::: callout-tip
**Good practice:**  
- Always ask for a **Markdown table** (easy to copy into your report).  
- Keep quotes short (≤25 words).  
- Mark missing info as *unknown* — don’t allow invention.  
:::

## Task 4 Drafting (First Pass)

**Goal:** Use AI to create a draft section, while staying evidence-based.  

Steps:  
1. 📂 Upload your paper or notes.  
2. 💬 Ask OpenWebUI:  
   *“Draft a 150–200 word abstract using only the uploaded document(s). Include background, objective, methods, results, and limitations.”*  
3. 📝 Review the draft carefully:  
   - Are all claims supported by the source?  
   - Are limitations included?  
   - Are there placeholders for citations?  

::: callout-tip
**Good practice:**  
- Use AI drafts as a **starting point**, never the final product.  
- Insert **[Author, Year]** placeholders for citations.  
- Remove or flag anything that isn’t clearly supported by evidence.  
:::


## Limitations of AI in Research

- ⚠️ **Hallucinations** — AI may invent facts or references  
- 📉 **Context limits** — large documents can exceed model capacity  
- 🎭 **Bias** — reflects patterns (and errors) in training data  
- 🔄 **No true understanding** — outputs are predictions, not reasoning  
- 🕵️ **Verification required** — every claim must be checked  

::: callout-note
**Remember:**  
AI is a **research assistant**, not an authority.  
Its value depends on **your critical review**.  
:::


## Ethics & Privacy

- 🔒 **Confidentiality** — never upload sensitive or unpublished data to public AI systems  
- 🛡️ **Safe space** — OpenWebUI keeps your work private and under your control  
- ⚖️ **Fair use** — cite properly, don’t let AI replace academic integrity  
- 🤝 **Responsible use** — AI supports your work, but you remain accountable  

::: callout-tip
**Best practice:**  
Use AI to **assist** research, not to bypass critical thinking, originality, or ethical standards.
