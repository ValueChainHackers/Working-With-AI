## 🎯 Overview
<!-- What this workshop is about, why it exists, and how it works as an evolving lab. -->
## 🎯 Overview

This workshop is about **using AI to accelerate your research** — not learning “AI for AI’s sake.”  
Your single interface is **OpenWebUI**. Through it, you’ll apply AI to speed up real tasks like:

- **Literature triage & synthesis** (quickly scan, summarize, compare sources)
- **Evidence extraction** (pull key data/quotes, build structured notes)
- **RAG over your files** (ask questions about PDFs you upload)
- **Web-assisted checking** (where enabled, verify claims and gather context)
- **Drafting & iteration** (turn outlines into drafts; refine with feedback)

This is a **living lab**: features may evolve or occasionally fail. That’s okay — your goal is still to **get work done** faster.  
When something breaks, you’ll log it briefly; when something works, you’ll capture **what prompt/pattern made it work**.  
Over time, we’ll unlock more capability inside OpenWebUI, but the focus remains: **use AI as a power tool for your research**.

**Format:** a **2-hour kick-off** to get productive quickly, then **1-hour monthly sessions** to apply AI to your current projects, deepen skills, and refine workflows.

**Mindset:** we use the **Conscious Competence** ladder — failure = information, iteration = progress — so your learning curve directly translates into **faster, better research outputs**.

---

## 🕹️ Your Mission
## 🧙‍♂️ Your Mission (The Campaign)

The world you must navigate is **your own research** — full of questions, data, texts, and stakeholders.  
Your quest is to become a **Researcher + AI**: using artificial intelligence as a set of new skills, gears, and spells to make your research faster, deeper, and more impactful.  

---

### 🏰 The Guild Hall: OpenWebUI
To support you on this journey, we’ve built **OpenWebUI** — a shared training ground.  
- Here you can experiment with AI without needing expensive models or local installs.  
- It is your **practice arena**: a safe place to test prompts, try tools, and learn strategies.  
- What you master here can later be carried into **other AI tools and platforms** that you may encounter beyond this workshop.  

Think of OpenWebUI not as the whole world, but as the **guild hall** where you equip yourself before venturing back into the field of your own research.  

---

### 🎲 Character Creation
Every adventurer-scholar chooses a path:  
- **The Researcher** → frames questions and interprets knowledge.  
- **The Analyst** → finds clarity in data and numbers.  
- **The Strategist** → maps systems, stakeholders, and long-term moves.  
- **The Innovator** → designs bold solutions and prototypes futures.  

Each class uses AI differently — but all work toward the same quest: Research + AI.  

---

### 🗺️ Main Quest
- **Summon Knowledge**: use RAG to query your documents and sources.  
- **Scout the Unknown**: test web search and external integrations.  
- **Forge Automations**: explore how pipelines or workflows cut repetitive tasks.  
- **Shape Ideas**: draft, refine, and iterate with AI assistance.  
- **Expand Skills**: carry what you learn into other AI tools beyond OpenWebUI.  

---

### 🧪 Side Quests
- Build your personal **spellbook of prompts**.  
- Log glitches and victories in your **Player Journal**.  
- Share discoveries with your guild — collaboration is a multiplier.  

---

### 🎭 The Dungeon Master
Your facilitator is the **Dungeon Master (DM)**:  
- They set the stage, unlock features, and narrate challenges.  
- They are also an explorer, mapping this evolving landscape with you.  
- Together, you co-create the rules of play as new tools emerge.  

---

### 🏆 Victory Conditions
- Progress through the **Competence Ladder**:  
  - *Unconscious Incompetence → Conscious Incompetence → Conscious Competence → Unconscious Competence*.  
- By the Final Boss (EOY presentations), you should have:  
  - **Concrete research outputs** accelerated with AI.  
  - **A tested workflow** you can repeat or adapt.  
  - **Transferable skills** to use AI in any platform beyond OpenWebUI.  

Your mission is not to “learn AI perfectly.”  
Your mission is to **become a Researcher + AI** — equipped, confident, and ready to bring new power to your own work.  

---

## 🗺️ Workshop Flow (The Campaign Levels)

Your journey is structured like a campaign:  
a **Tutorial**, followed by **Monthly Quests**, and ending in a **Final Boss** where you prove your mastery as Researcher + AI.  

---

### 🎮 Tutorial Level — The Guild Hall (Kick-Off, 2 hours)
- Enter the world of AI through **OpenWebUI**.  
- Learn basic spells: prompting, uploading documents, simple RAG queries.  
- Test your first artifacts (Search Orb, RAG Scrolls, Pipeline Forge).  
- Victory Condition: leave the guild hall knowing how to cast at least one AI spell on your own research.  

---

### 🗓️ Monthly Quests (1 hour each)
Each month you return to the Guild Hall to unlock new challenges and skills.  

#### 📖 February — Inspiration Quest  
- Meet mentors and explorers who share their AI journeys.  
- Try applying AI to your **first real research materials** (articles, data, drafts).  
- Victory Condition: journal one way AI accelerated your work.  

#### 🧠 March — Hackathon Quest  
- A brainstorming/hackathon-style event: teams explore bold uses of AI in research.  
- Push beyond comfort zones — try automations, external integrations, or unusual prompts.  
- Victory Condition: prototype one Research + AI workflow, however rough.  

#### 🔥 April — The Roast (Mid-Boss Encounter)  
- Present your AI-accelerated ideas to a “mock board.”  
- Defend your approach, collect stakeholder feedback, and refine.  
- Victory Condition: gain at least one actionable improvement from feedback.  

#### 🏹 June — Final Boss (EOY Presentation)  
- Present your research journey + how AI accelerated it.  
- Show concrete outputs: analyses, drafts, workflows, or prototypes.  
- Victory Condition: demonstrate that you are now **Researcher + AI** — wielding AI as a reliable ally.  

---

### 🧭 Progression System
You advance not by grades, but by leveling through the **Conscious Competence Ladder**:  
- 🟢 Lvl 0 → Unconscious Incompetence (“I don’t know what I don’t know”)  
- 🔴 Lvl 1 → Conscious Incompetence (“I know what doesn’t work yet”)  
- 🟡 Lvl 2 → Conscious Competence (“I can use AI when I focus”)  
- 🔵 Lvl 3 → Unconscious Competence (“AI is a natural extension of my research”)  

The DM (facilitator) will guide, but your XP comes from **practice, discovery, and shared learning**.  


## 🏰 Core Platform (The Guild Hall)

Every campaign needs a safe place to train and prepare.  
For this workshop, that place is **OpenWebUI** — our shared guild hall.  

- **Why this tool?**  
  Instead of requiring you to install AI locally or pay for commercial models,  
  we provide OpenWebUI as a central interface that is free to access during the campaign.  

- **What it is:**  
  OpenWebUI is a lightweight, flexible AI platform where you can:  
  - Write and test prompts.  
  - Upload documents and use RAG (Retrieve & Generate).  
  - Try out experimental features (search, pipelines, image, voice, code).  
  - Safely learn the mechanics of AI before applying them elsewhere.  

- **What it is not:**  
  OpenWebUI is **not** the whole world of AI.  
  It is a **training ground** where you develop skills and workflows that can later  
  be applied in **other AI tools and platforms** outside this workshop.  

💡 Think of OpenWebUI as your **first spellbook**:  
you learn incantations and techniques here,  
but once mastered, you can carry them into any other research context.  

## 🔓 Unlockable Features (Artifacts & Spells)

Within the Guild Hall (OpenWebUI), you will encounter a collection of **artifacts and spells**.  
Some are stable, others experimental. Part of your quest is to test them, discover their power,  
and learn how to wield them effectively in your research.
