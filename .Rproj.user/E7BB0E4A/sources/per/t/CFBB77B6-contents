# First Task

- 📝 Type a simple research question into OpenWebUI:  
  *“Summarize the key challenges in supply chain finance.”*  

- 🎯 Observe the response:  
  - How clear is it?  
  - What’s useful?  
  - What’s missing?  

::: callout-tip
**Remember:** This is your *assistant*, not an oracle.  
You control the process.

## Icebreaker — LogiBot Gone Rogue 🤖

You’re the logistics manager for a global coffee company.  
☕ Millions depend on you for their morning brew.  

But disaster strikes:  
- 🚢 A major European port is on strike.  
- 📦 Shipments are stuck.  
- 😱 Customers in Asia are furious.  

And worst of all... your shiny new AI assistant **LogiBot** has gone rogue!  
Instead of solutions, it spits out the **worst possible ideas**.  

::: callout-note
**Your challenge:**  
Spot what’s wrong with LogiBot’s “bad” answers and suggest better prompts.  
:::

## LogiBot’s Answer ❌

*"Don’t worry about the strike.  
Just ship everything by drone tomorrow.  
If that fails, tell customers to switch to tea instead."*  

---

::: callout-warning
⚠️ What’s wrong here?
- Unrealistic solution (no evidence or feasibility).  
- Ignores the actual problem (port strike).  
- No context from supply chain data.  
:::

::: callout-tip
💡 How to fix it:  
Ask a **specific, realistic prompt**:  
*“Given a port strike in Europe, what alternative transport routes could maintain supply to Asia?”*  
:::


## Prompting Basics

### ✅ Do
- Be **specific**: “Summarize in 150 words with 3 key findings.”  
- Add **structure**: request bullets, tables, or sections.  
- Provide **context**: mention the type of document or task.  
- Ask for **quotes or references** to support claims.  

### ❌ Common Mistakes
- Being too **vague or ambiguous** (“Improve logistics” → too broad).  
- Ignoring **role/context** (e.g. ask AI to act as a reviewer or analyst).  
- Asking for **opinions** instead of **evidence-based answers**.  

::: callout-tip
Think of prompting as writing a **research question**: clear, scoped, and answerable.  
:::


## Task 1 — Summarization

**Goal:** Create a clear, concise summary of a research abstract.

Steps:  
1. 📂 Upload a research abstract (PDF or text).  
2. 💬 Ask OpenWebUI: *“Summarize this abstract in 150 words.”*  
3. 🔎 Review the result — does it capture the main question, method, and findings?  

::: callout-tip
**Good practice:**  
- Keep the summary **short (120–150 words)**.  
- Include **3–5 key points** only.  
- If info is missing, mark it as *unknown* — don’t invent.  
:::

## Task 2 — Exploration

**Goal:** Ask deeper questions about a research document.  

Steps:  
1. 📂 Upload a paper or report.  
2. ❓ Ask OpenWebUI targeted questions, for example:  
   - *“What is the main research question and why does it matter?”*  
   - *“List the datasets and methods used.”*  
   - *“Summarize 3 key findings with evidence.”*  
   - *“What assumptions or limitations are mentioned?”*  
3. 🔎 Compare the answers with the text to check accuracy.  

::: callout-tip
**Good practice:**  
- Use **specific, structured prompts** (not just “Explain this”).  
- Always verify the AI’s response against the source.  
- Ask for **quotes or references to sections** where possible.  
:::

## Task 3 — Structuring Notes into a Table

**Goal:** Turn unstructured research notes into a clear, reusable format.  

Steps:  
1. 📂 Upload your notes or a research document.  
2. 💬 Ask OpenWebUI:  
   *“Organize the key concepts into a table with definition, evidence, and open questions.”*  
3. 📊 Review the table — is it faithful to the source? Are quotes properly cited?  

**Target structure:**  

| Concept | Definition | Evidence (quote) | Section/Page | Open Questions |
|---------|------------|------------------|--------------|----------------|

::: callout-tip
**Good practice:**  
- Always ask for a **Markdown table** (easy to copy into your report).  
- Keep quotes short (≤25 words).  
- Mark missing info as *unknown* — don’t allow invention.  
:::

## Task 4 — Drafting (First Pass)

**Goal:** Use AI to create a draft section, while staying evidence-based.  

Steps:  
1. 📂 Upload your paper or notes.  
2. 💬 Ask OpenWebUI:  
   *“Draft a 150–200 word abstract using only the uploaded document(s). Include background, objective, methods, results, and limitations.”*  
3. 📝 Review the draft carefully:  
   - Are all claims supported by the source?  
   - Are limitations included?  
   - Are there placeholders for citations?  

::: callout-tip
**Good practice:**  
- Use AI drafts as a **starting point**, never the final product.  
- Insert **[Author, Year]** placeholders for citations.  
- Remove or flag anything that isn’t clearly supported by evidence.  
:::


## Limitations of AI in Research

- ⚠️ **Hallucinations** — AI may invent facts or references  
- 📉 **Context limits** — large documents can exceed model capacity  
- 🎭 **Bias** — reflects patterns (and errors) in training data  
- 🔄 **No true understanding** — outputs are predictions, not reasoning  
- 🕵️ **Verification required** — every claim must be checked  

::: callout-note
**Remember:**  
AI is a **research assistant**, not an authority.  
Its value depends on **your critical review**.  
:::


## Ethics & Privacy

- 🔒 **Confidentiality** — never upload sensitive or unpublished data to public AI systems  
- 🛡️ **Safe space** — OpenWebUI keeps your work private and under your control  
- ⚖️ **Fair use** — cite properly, don’t let AI replace academic integrity  
- 🤝 **Responsible use** — AI supports your work, but you remain accountable  

::: callout-tip
**Best practice:**  
Use AI to **assist** research, not to bypass critical thinking, originality, or ethical standards.  
:::

## Case Study — AI in Supply Chains

### 🚀 Amazon
- **Demand Forecasting**: predicts demand for 400M+ products daily  
- **Robotics**: autonomous robots streamline warehouse operations  
- **Smart Routing**: routes optimized by traffic, weather, and delivery windows  
- **Sustainability**: packaging engine reduces waste  

---

### 📊 Procter & Gamble
- Used AI to analyze **real-time supplier, port, and weather data**  
- Predicted delays and **rerouted shipments** during the pandemic  
- Maintained supply when competitors faced shortages  
- Outcome: **customer trust + higher profits**  

::: callout-tip
These global examples show how **AI supports resilience and decision-making**.  
Today, you’ll see how **OpenWebUI** can bring similar capabilities to your research.  
:::

## Case Study — AI in Research

### 🎓 Literature Review
- Researcher uploads 10 PDFs into OpenWebUI  
- AI generates a **summary of each paper** (150 words)  
- Extracts **key findings & methods** into a Markdown table  
- Researcher cross-checks, then builds a review outline in 1 hour  
- Time saved: days of manual note-taking  

---

### 🧪 Data Exploration
- Researcher pastes raw survey results  
- AI suggests **themes, variables, and visualizations**  
- Drafts clear explanations for a report section  
- Researcher validates with real analysis tools (R/Python)  

::: callout-tip
AI doesn’t replace critical thinking — it **accelerates the routine work** so you can focus on insights.  
:::



## Application: Literature Review

**Goal:** speed up understanding of large sets of papers.  

How AI helps:  
- 📚 **Summarize** abstracts and introductions quickly  
- 🔍 **Compare** methods and findings across multiple studies  
- 🗂️ **Organize** results into tables or themes  
- 📝 **Draft** preliminary review notes for discussion  

::: callout-tip
**Good practice:**  
Always verify summaries against the original texts and keep track of exact references.  
:::



## Application: Data Support

**Goal:** use AI to clarify and communicate research data.  

How AI helps:  
- 📊 **Explain** variables, methods, and outputs in plain language  
- 📈 **Suggest** possible visualizations (charts, plots)  
- 🧮 **Check** calculations or provide simple code snippets  
- 🗂️ **Document** steps clearly for reproducibility  

::: callout-tip
**Good practice:**  
Always run data analysis in your own trusted tools (R, Python, Excel).  
Use AI for **supporting explanations** — not as the primary analysis engine.  
:::

## Application: Collaboration

**Goal:** make teamwork in research more efficient.  

How AI helps:  
- 📝 **Draft shared notes** after meetings or workshops  
- 📑 **Summarize** long email threads or documents for the group  
- 🔄 **Translate** text for international collaborators  
- 🎯 **Highlight action points** to keep teams aligned  

::: callout-tip
**Good practice:**  
Use AI to reduce **administrative overhead**,  
so teams can focus on **analysis, discussion, and decision-making**.  
:::
